# Introduction

Introducing my resume builder.
The main purpose is to discover all the new features of Vue3 including reactivity and composition.
In addition to that, I also wanted to test in depth HeadLess UI development and Tailwind customisation.
Last, I wanted to generate PDF, well that was the painful part...
